    Even with the "igmp_snooping_enable" configuration option stating that
    traffic would not be flooded to unregistered VMs when this option was
    enabled, the ML2/OVN driver didn't follow that behavior. This
    has now been fixed and ML2/OVN will no longer flood traffic to
    unregistered VMs when this configuration option is set to True.
