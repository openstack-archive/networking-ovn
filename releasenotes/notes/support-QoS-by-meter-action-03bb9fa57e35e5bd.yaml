    Currently, QoS is implemented by TC command of HV OS.
    This solution has many drawbacks, such as not supported
    VLAN network or VMs from same HV.
    Meter is a comfortable solution, which is implement
    in OpenFlow as an action, so it is flexible and exact.
    By meter action, we can implemented QoS from both directions,
    also, we can support DSCP. If we want to add other matches,
    it is also feasible.
