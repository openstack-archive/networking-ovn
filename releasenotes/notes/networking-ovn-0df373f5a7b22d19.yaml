    This is the initial release of OpenStack neutron integration with OVN.
    OVN provides virtual networking for Open vSwitch and is a component of
    the `Open vSwitch <http://openvswitch.org/>`_ project. The following
    virtual networking features are available. Some features are provided
    via a native OVN implementation or via a conventional neutron agent.

    * Layer-2 switching (native OVN implementation)
    * Layer-3 routing (native OVN implementation or conventional
      neutron layer-3 agent) The native OVN implementation supports
      distributed routing. However, it currently lacks support for
      floating IP addresses and NAT.
    * DHCP (conventional neuron DHCP agent)
    * Metadata (conventional neutron metadata agent)
    * DPDK - May be used with OVS using either the Linux kernel
      datapath or the DPDK datapath.

    The initial release also supports the following neutron API
    extensions, ``agent``, ``Address Scopes`` \*,
    ``Allowed Address Pairs``, ``Auto Allocated Topology Services``,
    ``Availability Zone``, ``Default Subnetpools``,
    ``DHCP Agent Scheduler``, ``Distributed Virtual Router`` \*,
    ``DNS Integration`` \*, ``HA Router extension`` \*,
    ``L3 Agent Scheduler`` \*,
    ``Network Availability Zone``, ``Network IP Availability``,
    ``Neutron external network``, ``Neutron Extra DHCP opts``,
    ``Neutron Extra Route``,
    ``Neutron L3 Configurable external gateway mode`` \*,
    ``Neutron L3 Router``,
    ``Network MTU``, ``Port Binding``, ``Port Security``,
    ``Provider Network``, ``Quality of Service``,
    ``Quota management support``, ``RBAC Policies``,
    ``Router Availability Zone`` \*, ``security-group``,
    ``standard-attr-description``, ``Subnet Allocation``,
    ``Tag support`` and ``Time Stamp Fields``.

    (\*) Only applicable when conventional neutron layer-3 agent enabled.
